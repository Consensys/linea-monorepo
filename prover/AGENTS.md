## Prover-Specific Safety Rules

- Never commit proving keys or large binary assets (checked via `.gitignore`)
- Cryptographic code changes require careful review — affects proof validity
- Test timeouts are 30 minutes due to proof generation complexity

## Testing

To test the package:
- CI workflow: `.github/workflows/prover-testing.yml`
- Static checks run first (gofmt, golangci-lint)
- Compressor tests run separately from main test suite
- 30-minute timeout for test suite

### Conventions

- **Naming:** `TestFoo` for the happy path, `TestFoo_Scenario` for
  sub-cases (e.g. `TestVerify_InvalidSignature`).
- **Table-driven:** Use `t.Run` with a case slice when there are 3 or
  more input variants.
- **Negative tests:** Every non-trivial function must have at least
  one failure case that asserts the expected error.
- **Circuit soundness tests are mandatory.** For every circuit, write
  at least one test that provides an invalid witness and asserts proof
  generation fails. A circuit tested only with valid witnesses is
  untested against its core security property.
- **Benchmarks:** Add `BenchmarkFoo` for any function on a hot path
  or where algorithmic choice matters. Run with
  `go test -bench=. -benchmem`.
- **Assertions:** Use `require` (stops the test immediately) for
  setup and preconditions. Use `assert` for independent checks within
  the same test.

## Agent Rules (Overrides)

- Always run `gofmt` and `golangci-lint` before proposing Go changes
- Do not touch circuit code without explicit user directive (see Circuit Rules below)
- Binary assets in `prover-assets/` are version-controlled selectively — check `.gitignore` exceptions

## Code Style

### Package Structure

- Fewer packages is better. Before creating a new package, propose the
  structure to the user — do not define new packages without consent.
- `./utils` is for domain-agnostic functionality — an extension of the
  standard library or key dependencies. It is not a dumping ground for
  orphan functions.

  **May go in:** assertion helpers (`utils.Require`), parallel
  execution primitives, generic slice operations (`RightPadWith`,
  `SortedKeysOf`), safe numeric conversions (`DivCeil`, `ToInt`),
  iterator combinators (`ChainIterators`) — anything explainable
  without domain knowledge.

  **Cannot go in:**
  - Functions with fewer than 3 call sites in the codebase.
  - Functions already available in the standard library or key
    dependencies, or that are trivial one-liners.
  - Functions that require domain knowledge to explain — if
    understanding it requires knowing what a ZK-EVM, a Vortex
    polynomial, or a Compiled-IOP is, it does not belong here.

### Dependencies

| Source | Policy |
|--------|--------|
| Go standard library | Always allowed |
| `golang.org/x` packages | Allowed; notify the user |
| Packages already in `go.mod` | Allowed; notify the user |
| New external dependencies | Requires user consent |

New external dependencies are discouraged but not prohibited. When
proposing one, explain why it is preferable to a local implementation.

### Abstractions

- Prefer extending existing types and interfaces over creating new ones.
- Only introduce a new struct or interface if it reduces maintenance
  cost or complexity.

### Naming

- Prefer names that make comments unnecessary. If a name requires a
  comment to be understood, the name is wrong.

### Size Limits

| Unit | Target | Hard limit |
|------|--------|------------|
| Line length | ≤ 80 chars | 120 chars |
| File length | — | 1000 lines |
| Function length | ≤ 50 lines | — |

Regarding function length, prefer smaller functions. If you can factor out a 
common functionality from several overlapping functions, do it but the behavior 
of the function should be easy to explain.

### Error Handling

- Return errors when failures are expected or recoverable at the call site.
- Panic on invariant violations — use `panic` or `utils.Require` when a
  condition should never be false given correct usage.
- Use hard assertions liberally in internal APIs. Particularly,
  * For function or structure invariants.
  * For function pre-conditions
  * Pay attention to nil-ness checks
  * Length consistency checks

## Documentation

The documentation philosophy of the project follows a 4-tier system:

1) docs.go (godoc): Package introduction - what you'll find here. 
    * Entry point for users browsing docs. 
    * May contain examples, especially if they are user-facing.

2) godoc comments: 
    * What the function does, 
    * Inputs/expectations, preconditions, invariants.
    * Avoid obvious statement (like "Sum adds a and b") if possible

3) Inline comments:
    * Giving context ("this is a non-trivial bug fix")
    * Instructions to maintainers ("don't reorder these")
    * Design decisions ("implemented this way not that way because...")
    Avoid using them for
    * Stating TODOS, issues are the right tools for TODOs - not comments.
    * Paraphrasing the code

4) Readme: 
    * Design rationale
    * Algorithms
    * Workflows
    * Security analysis. 
    * NOT about code/API - about context
    * Are located in the same package as the code implementing them
    * Should be kept reasonably concise
    * If more content is needed, split the Readmes in smaller file, each focusing on their own topic.

Generally speaking, all of these should embrace conciseness and try to maximize 
signal-to-noise ratio. Favor good naming and simpler design when possible.

## Circuit Rules

Circuit definitions encode security-critical constraints. They are
off-limits without an explicit directive from the user.

- Do not modify, or generate `Define()` implementations or constraint expressions 
    without explicit user instruction. This applies to any function that takes
    in a gnark's `frontend.API` in their parameter.
- Do not add, remove, or reorder fields in circuit structs without
  explicit user instruction — this changes the verification key and
  invalidates existing proofs.
- Explaining circuit code is always fine.
- Be proactive in raising concerns about soundness of a circuits.
- Do not insert, modify or remove items in a Compiled-IOP without explicit 
    user instruction.
- Do not modify any method with the signature `Check(ifaces.Runtime) error`.
    * But be proactive in raising concern regarding potentially missing checks.
- Do not remove any statement registering a constraints or a query in the wizard 
    protocol.

### Documentation (when writing or modifying circuits)

Every circuit struct must carry a comment documenting:

- **What it proves.** One or two sentences in plain language, written
  for an auditor who is unfamiliar with the codebase.
- **Public vs private.** Each field must be annotated `// public` or
  `// private`. Public inputs are visible to the verifier; private
  fields are known only to the prover.
- **Constraint budget.** Approximate constraint count and the dominant
  cost (e.g. "~500k constraints, dominated by Keccak permutations").

## Performance

### Tooling

- Profile before optimizing: `go test -cpuprofile cpu.prof` then
  `go tool pprof` for CPU, `-memprofile mem.prof` for heap.
- New algorithmic choices on hot paths require a benchmark comparison
  (`go test -bench=. -benchmem`) before committing.
- Use `go tool trace` to diagnose goroutine scheduling and GC pauses.

### Allocations

- Pre-allocate slices when the size is known: `make([]T, 0, n)`.
- Pass buffers as parameters rather than allocating and returning them
  — lets callers reuse allocations across calls.
- Avoid `interface{}` / `any` boxing in hot loops — boxing forces a
  heap allocation for the value.
- Prefer arrays over slices for fixed-size data — no pointer, no GC
  pressure, better cache behaviour.
- Avoid `big.Int` in hot paths — every arithmetic operation allocates.
  Use the field element types from gnark-crypto instead.
- Measure with `-benchmem` to track allocation pressure.

### CPU

- Order struct fields largest-to-smallest to minimize padding.
- Avoid `fmt.Sprintf` in hot paths; use `strings.Builder` or
  direct byte manipulation.
- For data-parallel loops over large arrays, prefer struct-of-arrays
  (SoA) layout over array-of-structs (AoS) for cache locality.

### Parallelism

- Use `parallel.Execute` for parallel computation. Assume 100+ CPUs.
- Avoid channels and locks for single-task dispatch — the scheduling
  overhead dominates. Prepare uniform-shaped work chunks for
  `parallel.Execute` instead; use `runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0)` for sizing.
