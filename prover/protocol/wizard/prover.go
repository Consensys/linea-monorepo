// ProverStep represents an operation to be performed by the prover of a

// to the protocol specification [CompiledIOP] by appending it to the field
// [CompiledIOP.SubProvers].
//
//	CompiledIOP.SubProvers.AppendToInner(round, proverStep)
//
// The ProverStep function may interact with the prover runtime to resolve
// the values of an already assigned item: ([ifaces.Colssignment], coin,
// [ifaces.QueryParams], ...).
//
// The ProverStep function that we pass as the `highLevelProver` argument of
// [Prove] function has the particularity that it is allowed to span
// over multiple interaction-rounds between the prover and the verifier. This
// is a behavior that we intend to deprecate and it should not be used by the
// prover as this tends to create convolutions in the runtime of the prover.

// the random coins that are sampled by the verifier. The object is implicitly
// constructed by the [Prove] function and it should not be explicitly
// constructed by the user.
//
// Instead, the user should interact with the prover runtime within a
