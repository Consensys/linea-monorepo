// collects the descriptions of the involved columns in protocol, their status
// and their sizes. It also registers all the random challenge coins that the
// verifier of the protocol is expected to send during the verification process.
// Additionally, the CompiledIOP object can register "queries". Queries are an
// indication that something is not proven yet but are expected to be justified
// during the compilation steps. Additionally, the compiled IOP object registers
// the computations of the prover and the verifier at every round of the
// protocol.

// it via the Builder.CompiledIOP object. Namely, the zero value of the
