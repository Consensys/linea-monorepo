# Vortex Proof Size Optimization

This document describes the four optimizations applied to reduce the final Vortex proof size
produced by `fullInitialCompilationSuite` (`zkevm/full.go`).

---

## Background

### Proof components

The three main components of the final Vortex proof are:

| Component | Description | Scales with |
|---|---|---|
| `U_alpha` | Random linear combination of all committed polynomials | (codeword = blowup x polynomial degree) |
| `SELECTED_COL` | Revealed column values at K randomly chosen positions | numRows (# committed polynomials) |
| `MERKLEPROOF` | Sibling hashes for Merkle path verification | log₂(codeword) × K × numRounds |

### Committed cells and their effect on proof size

The Vortex commitment matrix has dimensions:

```
committed_cells = numRows × T

  numRows  total number of committed polynomials across all rounds
  T        polynomial degree  (= codewordSize / blowup)
```

Reducing `numRows` shrinks `SELECTED_COL`; reducing `T` shrinks `U_alpha` and `MERKLEPROOF`.
A single large reduction in `committed_cells` can fundamentally reduce both factors.

---

## Optimization 1: GKR Poseidon2

**Compiler step:** `poseidon2.CompileGKRPoseidon2`

### Mechanism

Without GKR, every Poseidon2 hash call is proven by explicit polynomial columns — one column
per intermediate round state, S-box computation, and round constant. Batching N hash calls
therefore produces O(N × permutation\_rounds) committed columns.

With GKR, the entire batch is proven via a sumcheck argument. The GKR verifier needs only a
short transcript column (`GKR_Poseidon2_TRANSCRIPT`) regardless of batch size, replacing the
dense intermediate-state columns entirely.

### Effect on proof size

GKR primarily reduces `numRows` (fewer committed polynomials). This directly shrinks
`SELECTED_COL`. Additionally, fewer columns fed into each self-recursion round means the
next Vortex in the chain operates on a smaller matrix, compounding savings across all
recursion levels.

| | Committed cells | Proof cells |
|---|---|---|
| Before GKR | 16,891,904 | 919,240 |
| After GKR | 7,127,040 | 800,456 |
| **Reduction** | **−57.8%** | **−118,784 (−12.9%)** |

---

## Optimization 2: Reduce U_alpha by the Blowup Factor

**Option:** `WithUAlphaCoefficients()`

### Evaluation form vs. coefficient form

In standard Vortex, `U_alpha` — the random linear combination of all committed polynomials —
is sent as a Reed-Solomon codeword of N evaluations over the extension field:

```
Eval mode:   N = T × blowup_factor   extension-field elements
Coeff mode:  T                        extension-field elements
```

`WithUAlphaCoefficients()` switches to coefficient form: the prover sends T polynomial
coefficients instead of N codeword evaluations. The verifier reconstructs the full codeword
via a forward FFT (provided as a hint in the gnark circuit).

### Interaction with column size

With a fixed committed-cell budget, increasing `T` (larger polynomial degree) reduces
`numRows`, which shrinks `SELECTED_COL`. In evaluation mode this comes at the cost of a
larger `U_alpha` (N = T × blowup grows). In coefficient mode `U_alpha` stays at T regardless
of blowup, so `T` can be increased 'freely' without any U_alpha penalty — `SELECTED_COL`
shrinks while `U_alpha` stays relatively small.

### Impact (Vortex-4, T=8192, blowup=16)

| Mode | U_alpha size | Bytes |
|---|---|---|
| Eval (before) | N = 131,072 ext elements | 131,072 × 16 = **2,097,152** |
| Coeff (after) | T = 8,192 ext elements | 8,192 × 16 = **131,072** |
| **Saving** | 122,880 ext elements | **~1.9 MB** |

---

## Optimization 3: Skip Duplicated Proof Columns

**Option:** `SkipSelfRecursionProofColumns()`

### What is duplicated

The Vortex prover registers three opened-column proof objects:

- `SELECTED_COL` — all rounds combined (SIS + non-SIS), consumed by the Schwartz-Zippel verifier
- `SELECTED_COL_SIS` — SIS rounds only
- `SELECTED_COL_NON_SIS` — non-SIS rounds only

The split is needed by self-recursion: SIS openings are hashed via lattice-SIS and non-SIS
openings via Poseidon2, and these are verified independently. The concatenated
`SELECTED_COL` is also registered for the overall verifier:

```
SELECTED_COL = concat(SELECTED_COL_NON_SIS, SELECTED_COL_SIS)
```

### Why they are dead weight on the final Vortex

On the final Vortex (marked `PremarkAsSelfRecursed()`) there is no subsequent self-recursion
step, so `SELECTED_COL_SIS` and `SELECTED_COL_NON_SIS` are registered as proof columns but
**no verifier ever reads them**. `SkipSelfRecursionProofColumns()` suppresses their
registration entirely, saving one full copy of the split-column data.

---

## Optimization 4: Skip Precomputed Merkle Proof

**Option:** `SkipPrecomputedMerkleProof()`

### Why the precomputed Merkle proof is redundant

For **committed** columns the Merkle proof is essential: without it the prover could supply
a fabricated `selectedCol[j]` that satisfies the linear-combination check but does not
correspond to the committed codeword.

For **precomputed** columns the situation is different:

| Column type | Can prover fake `selectedCol`? | Merkle proof needed? |
|---|---|---|
| Committed | Yes — by back-solving Y_i | **Yes** |
| Precomputed | No — Y_precomp is verifier-computed | **No** |

`ExplicitPolynomialEval` (in `verifier.go`) runs unconditionally at the last round and
evaluates each precomputed polynomial directly at the challenge point x, pinning `Y_precomp`
to a fixed verifier-computed value. The Schwartz-Zippel check then enforces consistency
with `selectedCol_precomp`. Since `Y_precomp` is independent of the prover, the Merkle path
adds no additional security and can be dropped.

### MerkleProofSize formula

```
MerkleProofSize = NextPowerOfTwo(K × numRounds × depth) × 8
```

where `depth = log₂(codewordSize)`, K = number of opened columns, and `numRounds` counts
only committed rounds (precomputed round excluded when `SkipPrecomputedMerkleProof` is set).

### Why the saving is binary

The saving only materialises when removing the precomputed round crosses a `NextPowerOfTwo`
boundary downward. With the current parameters (K=64, 7 committed rounds, depth=17):

| Rounds | K × rounds × depth | NextPow2 | Cells |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 (with precomp) | 64 × 8 × 17 = 8,704 | 16,384 | 16,384 × 8 = **131,072** |
| 7 (skip precomp) | 64 × 7 × 17 = 7,616 | 8,192 | 8,192 × 8 = **65,536** |
| **Saving** | | | **65,536 cells (262,144 bytes)** |

At depth=16 (T=4096) both cases round to NextPow2=8192 and there is no saving. The
optimization is effective here because `WithTargetColSize(1<<13)` targets T=8192, giving
depth=17.

## Benchmark Results

`BenchmarkProfileSelfRecursion` — realistic-segment, T3=4096, T4=8192.
Cell counts use the base-field unit (4 bytes); extension-field elements in `U_alpha` are
weighted ×4 when computing totals.
