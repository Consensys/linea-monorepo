# `compress` library
`compress` implements a lightweight, deflate-like compression algorithm designed to have a simple, zk-friendly decompression algorithm.
We also provide a [zk decompressor in `gnark`](https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/tree/master/std/compress). 

`compress` is an Apache 2.0 licensed project.

## How to use
The `Compressor` class in the `lzss` package does all the work.
* Use the `NewCompressor` method to create an instance.
* Following golang conventions, the compressor implements the `io.Writer` interface, and data can be fed to it through the `Write` method.
* To retrieve the compressed data, use the `Bytes` method.
* For use-cases where raw data streams in and compressed blobs of only a limited size can be emitted, `Len` and `Revert` methods are provided to ensure maximal use of output space.
* For convenience, a `Compress` wrapper method is also provided, which compresses the entire input in one go and returns the compressed data.

## Example
```go
d := []byte("hello world, hello wordl")
compressor, _ := lzss.NewCompressor(nil, lzss.BestCompression)
c, _ := compressor.Compress(d)
dBack, _ := Decompress(c, nil)
if !bytes.Equal(d, dBack) {
    panic("decompression failed")
}
```


For a complete example making use of the dictionary and revert features, see [`TestRevert`](https://github.com/Consensys/compress/blob/main/lzss/compress_test.go#L299).

## Specification
### A note on the encoding of numerical values
Non-enumerated numbers encoded in `n` bits represent values from `1` to `2ⁿ`, inclusive. More significant bits come earlier in the stream, so if the encoding happens to be byte-aligned, it will be Big-Endian. For example the 9-bit stream `111001011` represents 460.
### Compressed file format
The compressed output is structured as follows:
```
              0   1   2   3...
            +---+---+---+===============+
            |  VSN  | L |... PHRASES ...|
            +---+---+---+===============+
```
* `VSN` is a 16-bit version number, currently `0x0000`.
* `L` is an 8-bit number representing the "compression level". A value of `0x00` indicates no compression at all, whereby `PHRASES` will consist of a literal copy of the data. Other acceptable values for `L` are 1, 2, 4, or 8. Concretely, this value indicates the size (in bits) of a compressed word. Words are a SNARK-side consideration, and the larger they are, the fewer constraints the decompressor would have, at some cost to the compression ratio.
* A compressor `PHRASE` is one of the following:
  - A byte, less than 253, to be interpreted as a literal.
  - A long back-reference: (Note: from here-on data are represented with bit-level precision)
    ```
              0..7  8..15   16..16+NBBITS_LONG_OFS
            +------+------+------------------------+
            | 0xFD | LEN  |        OFFSET          |
            +------+------+------------------------+
    ```
    , where `NBBITS_LONG_OFS = ⌈19/L⌉ * L`
  - A short back-reference:
    ```
              0..7  8..15   16..16+NBBITS_SHORT_OFS
            +------+------+------------------------+
            | 0xFE | LEN  |        OFFSET          |
            +------+------+------------------------+
    ```
    , where `NBBITS_SHORT_OFS = ⌈14/L⌉ * L`
  - A dictionary reference:
    ```
            0..7  8..15   16..16+NBBITS_DICT_ADDR
          +------+------+------------------------+
          | 0xFF | LEN  |         ADDR           |
          +------+------+------------------------+
    ```
    , where `NBBITS_DICT_ADDR = ⌈log₂(DICT_SIZE)/L⌉ * L`, and `DICT_SIZE` is the size of the dictionary in bytes.
### Interpreting "references"
A back-reference is an imperative to copy from already decompressed data. The "offset" field indicates how far back in the decompressed data to copy from, and the "length" field indicates how many bytes to copy. A back-reference may overlap with its own output, to create so-called "run length encodings", where many copies of the same byte are represented by a single back-reference.

The "address" field in a dictionary reference indicates where in the dictionary to copy from. In accordance with the number encoding rules above, the bytes in the dictionary are indexed starting at 1. The dictionary is an unstructured, user-provided stream of bytes that domain knowledge suggests are likely to occur in the data. It can improve the compression ratio, especially for small data. The dictionary is not part of the compressed data, and is not transmitted. Users are responsible for ensuring that the same dictionary is used by both the compressor and the decompressor. Since the special characters `0xFD`, `0xFE`, and `0xFF` cannot be represented by any other means than a dictionary reference, the compressor and decompressor will add them to the dictionary before using it, if they are not already present. This may affect the values `DICT_SIZE` and `NBBITS_DICT_ADDR`.
