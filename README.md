This is the principal Linea repository. It mainly includes the smart contracts covering Linea's core functions, the prover in charge of generating ZK proofs, the coordinator responsible for multiple orchestrations, and the Postman to execute bridge messages.

It serves developers by making the Linea tech stack open source under the [Apache 2.0](LICENSE-APACHE) and the [MIT](LICENSE-MIT) licenses.

## What is Linea?

[Linea](https://linea.build) is a developer-ready layer 2 network scaling Ethereum. It's secured with a zero-knowledge rollup, built on lattice-based cryptography, and powered by [Consensys](https://consensys.io).

Linea is compatible with the execution clients [Besu](https://github.com/besu-eth/besu/) or [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum). To run a full node, an execution client is paired with the consensus client [Maru](https://github.com/Consensys/maru).

## Get started

If you already have an understanding of the tech stack, use our [Get Started](docs/get-started.md) guide.

For developers looking to build services locally (such as, the coordinator), see our detailed [Local Development Guide](docs/local-development-guide.md).

## Release workflows

Releases are driven by GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`. There are two flavors: **per-component releases** and **milestone releases**.

### Release tag and version

Release tag of each component is in the format of `releases/[component]/v[semver]` and the semver version is computed from the relevant Git history commit messages by using [git-cliff](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff)

### Per-component release

Each component has its own release workflow. Run the one that matches the component you want to ship:

| Component        | Workflow                                         | Release tag pattern              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| linea-besu       | [.github/workflows/linea-besu-release.yml](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/actions/workflows/linea-besu-release.yml)       | `releases/linea-besu-package/v[semver]` |
| coordinator      | [.github/workflows/coordinator-release.yml](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/actions/workflows/coordinator-release.yml)      | `releases/coordinator/v[semver]`        |
| postman          | [.github/workflows/postman-release.yml](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/actions/workflows/postman-release.yml)          | `releases/postman/v[semver]`            |
| prover           | [.github/workflows/prover-release.yml](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/actions/workflows/prover-release.yml)           | `releases/prover/v[semver]`             |
| tx-exclusion-api | [.github/workflows/tx-exclusion-api-release.yml](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/actions/workflows/tx-exclusion-api-release.yml) | `releases/tx-exclusion-api/v[semver]`   |

Notes:

- **Branches.** A per-component release can be cut from either `main` or a feature branch (e.g. for a hot-fix release).
- **Feature-branch restriction.** When the workflow is run from a feature branch, `release_tag_suffix` is **required** (e.g. producing `releases/coordinator/v1.2.3-hotfix`). Without a suffix the new tag could collide with tags produced from other branches.
- **Docker image suffix.** `image_tag_suffix` is **optional**.
- **GitHub Release page.** Each successful run publishes a GitHub Release containing the updated component `CHANGELOG.md` and the docker image pull instructions.

### Milestone release

Milestone releases bundle every component into a single Linea release.

- **Workflow:** [.github/workflows/linea-milestone-release.yml](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/actions/workflows/linea-milestone-release.yml)
- **Release tag pattern:** `releases/linea/v[semver]`
- **Branch:** can only be run from `main`.
- **`release_tag_suffix`:** when set, the suffix is applied **only** to the milestone tag (e.g. `releases/linea/v1.2.3-rc1`). Per-component release tags are not affected.
- **`image_tag_suffix`:** when set, every component's docker image gets an additional suffixed tag (alongside the unsuffixed one).

#### Unified-cut behavior

For each component, the milestone workflow decides between two paths based on whether the component's release version has bumped at the milestone commit:

- **Bumped → release the component.** A new per-component release is cut as part of the milestone (new tag, docker image, GitHub Release page).
- **Not bumped → re-tag only.** The existing docker image associated with the component's latest release tag is re-tagged with `image_tag_suffix` (if given). No new component release is cut.

The milestone GitHub Release page aggregates the `CHANGELOG` entries from every component (newly released or carried over) and lists their docker image pull instructions.

## Looking for the Linea code?

Linea's stack is made up of multiple repositories, these include:

- This repo, [linea-monorepo](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo): The main repository for the Linea stack & network
> Also maintains a set of Linea-Besu plugins for the sequencer and RPC nodes.
- [linea-besu-upstream](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-besu-upstream/): Besu build configured for Linea
- [linea-tracer](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-tracer): Linea-Besu plugin which produces the traces that the constraint system applies and that serve as inputs to the prover
- [linea-constraints](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-constraints): Implementation of the constraint system from the specification
- [linea-specification](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-specification): Specification of the constraint system defining Linea's zkEVM

Linea abstracts away the complexity of this technical architecture to allow developers to:

- [Bridge tokens](https://docs.linea.build/developers/guides/bridge)
- [Deploy a contract](https://docs.linea.build/developers/quickstart/deploy-smart-contract)
- [Run a node](https://docs.linea.build/developers/guides/run-a-node)

... and more.

## How to contribute

Contributions are welcome!

### Guidelines for non-code and other trivial contributions

Please keep in mind that we do not accept non-code contributions like fixing comments, typos or some other trivial fixes. Although we appreciate the extra help, managing lots of these small contributions is unfeasible, and puts extra pressure in our continuous delivery systems (running all tests, etc). Feel free to open an issue pointing to any of those errors, and we will batch them into a single change.

1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/issues)
> If the proposed update is non-trivial, also tag us for discussion.
2. Submit the update as a pull request from your [fork of this repo](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/fork), and tag us for review.
> Include the issue number in the pull request description and (optionally) in the branch name.

Consider starting with a ["good first issue"](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
