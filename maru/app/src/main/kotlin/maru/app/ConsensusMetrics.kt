 * Micrometer-based consensus metrics that record QBFT phase latencies as histograms,
 * labeled by [role] (proposer vs non-proposer).
 *
 * Role detection: if a PROPOSAL was received via P2P for a given block, this node was a non-proposer;
 * otherwise it was the proposer (proposers create the PROPOSAL locally and never receive it back via gossipsub).
 *
 * Lifecycle: create once per [MaruApp] init (when `config.qbft != null`), then call the `record*` methods
 * from the observer callbacks. Stale per-block state is cleaned up automatically.
