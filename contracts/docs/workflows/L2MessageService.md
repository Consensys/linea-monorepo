# 📘 L2 Message Service Core Admin Workflows

Welcome to the **L2 Message Service** documentation. This collection of guides outlines key privileged workflows that govern the operation and upgrade lifecycle of the L2 Message Service smart contract. These workflows are designed to be executed via multisig-controlled safes, with strong verification and simulation practices to ensure safety and auditability.

Each section below links to a dedicated Markdown document detailing that category of administrative action.
