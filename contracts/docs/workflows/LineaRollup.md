# 📘 LineaRollup Core Admin Workflows

Welcome to the **LineaRollup** documentation. This collection of guides outlines key privileged workflows that govern the operation and upgrade lifecycle of the LineaRollup smart contract. These workflows are designed to be executed via multisig-controlled safes, with strong verification and simulation practices to ensure safety and auditability.

Each section below links to a dedicated Markdown document detailing that category of administrative action.

## ✅ Notes

- All workflows require transaction simulation and parameter verification.
- Some admin operations are governed by time-locked multisigs.
- Contract addresses and roles are listed inline in each document.
