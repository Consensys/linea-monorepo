# 🛠️ Executing TokenBridge Admin Functions (Excluding Pausing)

This guide outlines how authorized safe members can execute core **TokenBridge admin functions** like setting or removing reserved addresses or setting custom contracts and message services.

**Note**: These contracts are governed by the [Security Council Charter](../../security-council-charter.md).

---

## 🟧 Flow: Admin Execution Path

**Actor:** Safe Member  
**Actions:**

- Adds a transaction via **Security Council** or **Operational Safe**
- Targets the relevant **TokenBridge Proxy**
- Calls one of the following functions:
  - `setCustomContract`
  - `removeReserved`
  - `setMessageService`
  - `setReserved`

**Execution Path:**
```
Safe Member
    → Security Council / Operational Safe
        → targets Proxy
            → calls admin function
                → signs and executes on-chain
```

**Verification Requirements:**
- ✅ Transaction hash, parameters, and simulation must be verified
