# 🔄 Upgrading a Contract Without Calling a Reinitialize Function

This guide outlines the secure process for upgrading a contract (e.g. **LineaRollup**, **L2MessageService**, **TokenBridge**) without calling a reinitialize function, via a timelock-protected upgrade flow.

**Note**: These contracts are governed by the [Security Council Charter](../../security-council-charter-v1.3.md).

---

## 🟨 1. Deploy Implementation of Upgradable Contract

**Actor:** Well-Known Deployer  
**Actions:**

- Deploys a new `Implementation` contract (e.g. `0xAbCd1234`)
- The implementation:
  - ✅ Must be **verified on Etherscan or Linescan**
  - ✅ Must match **audited code** confirmed by multiple auditors
  - ✅ Bytecode must be **verified** to match the audit

## 🗂️ Function Signatures

| 4bytes | Signature                              |
|-------|---------------------------------------|
| `0x99a88ec4`     | upgrade(address,address)                   |

---

## 🟧 2. Schedule Upgrade Transaction

**Timeframe:** Some time after deployment  
**Actor:** Council Member  
**Actions:**

- Adds a **scheduled upgrade transaction** via the `Security Council Safe`
- The transaction:
  - Is routed through the `TimelockController`
  - Targets the `ProxyAdmin`
  - Calls the `upgrade()` function to set the proxy’s implementation to the new contract address (e.g. `0xAbCd1234`)
  - Final target: the `Proxy` contract

**Verification Requirements:**
- ✅ Transaction hash, details, and simulation must be verified
- ✅ Function and parameters must be verified

---

## 🟩 3. Execute Upgrade Transaction After Delay

**Timeframe:** After the configured delay  
**Actor:** Council Member  
**Actions:**

- Adds a matching **execute transaction** through the `Security Council Safe`
- Routed again through the `TimelockController`
- Reaches `ProxyAdmin`, which executes the upgrade on the `Proxy`

**Outcome:**  
➡️ Proxy’s implementation is updated (contract logic changed)

**Verification Requirements:**
- ✅ Same transaction hash, parameters, and targets must match scheduled version

## ✅ Security Summary

- All upgrades go through a **timelock delay** using multisig control
- Contract upgrades do **not require reinitialization**
- **Transaction simulation and parameter verification** are essential at both stages
