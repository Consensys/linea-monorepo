# 🔁 Upgrading a Contract While Calling a Reinitialize Function

This guide outlines the process of **upgrading an upgradable contract** (e.g. **LineaRollup**, **L2MessageService**, **TokenBridge**) and calling a **reinitialize function** in the same transaction. This flow ensures integrity while applying critical upgrades.

---

## 🟨 1. Deploy Implementation of Upgradable Contract

**Actor:** Well-Known Deployer  
**Actions:**

- Deploys a new `Implementation` contract (e.g. `0xAbCd1234`)
- The implementation:
  - ✅ Must be **verified on Etherscan or Linescan**
  - ✅ Must be **audited and bytecode-confirmed** by multiple auditors

---

## 🟧 2. Schedule Upgrade Transaction with Reinitialization

**Timeframe:** Some time after deployment  
**Actor:** Council Member  
**Actions:**

- Adds a **scheduled transaction** via the `Security Council Safe`
- Routed through the `TimelockController`
- Targets the `ProxyAdmin`
- Calls `upgradeAndCall()`:
  - Sets the proxy implementation to `0xAbCd1234`
  - Immediately calls a **reinitialize function** (with or without parameters)

**Verification Requirements:**
- ✅ Transaction hash, details, and simulation must be verified
- ✅ Function name, arguments, and reinit logic must be confirmed

---

## 🟩 3. Execute the Transaction After Delay

**Timeframe:** After the configured delay  
**Actor:** Council Member  
**Actions:**

- Adds and signs an **execute transaction** via the `Security Council Safe`
- Routed through `TimelockController` → `ProxyAdmin` → `Proxy`
- Executes `upgradeAndCall()` with:
  - Implementation update
  - Reinitialization function call

**Outcome:**  
➡️ Proxy’s implementation is upgraded and new state is initialized

**Verification Requirements:**
- ✅ Same payload as scheduled
- ✅ Parameters and reinit target must be verified
