# `LineaSequencerUptimeFeed`

L2 contract that receives status updates,
 and records a new answer if the status changed.

### typeAndVersion

```solidity
string typeAndVersion
```

### FEED_UPDATER_ROLE

```solidity
bytes32 FEED_UPDATER_ROLE
```

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(bool _initialStatus, address _admin, address _feedUpdater) public
```

_NB: The l1Sender parameter in the BaseSequencerUptimeFeed constructor is set as address(0) because it is not used.
AccessControl is used instead to manage permissions._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| _initialStatus | bool | The initial status of the feed. |
| _admin | address | The address of the admin that can manage the feed. |
| _feedUpdater | address | The address of the feed updater that can update the status. |

### _validateSender

```solidity
function _validateSender(address) internal view
```

Internal function to check if the sender is allowed to update the status.

_NB: The parameter is not used here because the function relies on msg.sender instead of l1Sender.
NB: The l1Sender storage variable from the BaseSequencerUptimeFeed contract is not used.
AccessControl is used instead to manage permissions._
