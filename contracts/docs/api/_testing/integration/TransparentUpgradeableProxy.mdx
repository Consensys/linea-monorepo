# `IERC1822Proxiable`

### proxiableUUID

```solidity
function proxiableUUID() external view returns (bytes32)
```

_Returns the storage slot that the proxiable contract assumes is being used to store the implementation
address.

IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be considered proxiable itself, because this risks
bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out of gas. Thus it is critical that this
function revert if invoked through a proxy._

# `IERC1967`

### Upgraded

```solidity
event Upgraded(address implementation)
```

_Emitted when the implementation is upgraded._

### AdminChanged

```solidity
event AdminChanged(address previousAdmin, address newAdmin)
```

_Emitted when the admin account has changed._

### BeaconUpgraded

```solidity
event BeaconUpgraded(address beacon)
```

_Emitted when the beacon is changed._

# `IBeacon`

### implementation

```solidity
function implementation() external view returns (address)
```

_Must return an address that can be used as a delegate call target.

{BeaconProxy} will check that this address is a contract._

# `Address`

### isContract

```solidity
function isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool)
```

_Returns true if `account` is a contract.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is unsafe to assume that an address for which this function returns
false is an externally-owned account (EOA) and not a contract.

Among others, `isContract` will return false for the following
types of addresses:

 - an externally-owned account
 - a contract in construction
 - an address where a contract will be created
 - an address where a contract lived, but was destroyed

Furthermore, `isContract` will also return true if the target contract within
the same transaction is already scheduled for destruction by `SELFDESTRUCT`,
which only has an effect at the end of a transaction.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
You shouldn't rely on `isContract` to protect against flash loan attacks!

Preventing calls from contracts is highly discouraged. It breaks composability, breaks support for smart wallets
like Gnosis Safe, and does not provide security since it can be circumvented by calling from a contract
constructor.

### sendValue

```solidity
function sendValue(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) internal
```

_Replacement for Solidity's `transfer`: sends `amount` wei to
`recipient`, forwarding all available gas and reverting on errors.

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884[EIP1884] increases the gas cost
of certain opcodes, possibly making contracts go over the 2300 gas limit
imposed by `transfer`, making them unable to receive funds via
`transfer`. {sendValue} removes this limitation.

https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/[Learn more].

IMPORTANT: because control is transferred to `recipient`, care must be
taken to not create reentrancy vulnerabilities. Consider using
{ReentrancyGuard} or the
https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.0/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern[checks-effects-interactions pattern]._

### functionCall

```solidity
function functionCall(address target, bytes data) internal returns (bytes)
```

_Performs a Solidity function call using a low level `call`. A
plain `call` is an unsafe replacement for a function call: use this
function instead.

If `target` reverts with a revert reason, it is bubbled up by this
function (like regular Solidity function calls).

Returns the raw returned data. To convert to the expected return value,
use https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html?highlight=abi.decode#abi-encoding-and-decoding-functions[`abi.decode`].

Requirements:

- `target` must be a contract.
- calling `target` with `data` must not revert.

_Available since v3.1.__

### functionCall

```solidity
function functionCall(address target, bytes data, string errorMessage) internal returns (bytes)

### functionCallWithValue

```solidity
function functionCallWithValue(address target, bytes data, uint256 value) internal returns (bytes)

Requirements:

- the calling contract must have an ETH balance of at least `value`.
- the called Solidity function must be `payable`.

function functionCallWithValue(address target, bytes data, uint256 value, string errorMessage) internal returns (bytes)

### verifyCallResultFromTarget

```solidity
function verifyCallResultFromTarget(address target, bool success, bytes returndata, string errorMessage) internal view returns (bytes)

the revert reason or using the provided one) in case of unsuccessful call or if target was not a contract.

_Available since v4.8.__

### verifyCallResult

```solidity
function verifyCallResult(bool success, bytes returndata, string errorMessage) internal pure returns (bytes)
