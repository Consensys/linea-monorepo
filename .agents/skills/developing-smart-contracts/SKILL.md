# Linea Smart Contract Development

Best practices for developing Solidity smart contracts on Linea blockchain. Contains
rules covering documentation, naming, structure, and code style.

Reference: [Linea Contract Style Guide](contracts/docs/contract-style-guide.md)

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Writing new Solidity contracts for Linea
- Reviewing smart contract code
- Refactoring existing contracts
- Adding NatSpec docstring documentation
- Setting up contract file structure

## Licenses

// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 OR MIT

## Solidity Pragma

- Contracts: `0.8.33` (exact)
- Interfaces, abstract contracts, libraries: `^0.8.33` (caret)

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category       | Impact   | Rule File                |
| -------- | -------------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| 1        | Gas optimization    | CRITICAL | `rules/gas-optimization.md`   |
| 2        | NatSpec Docstrings | HIGH     | `rules/natspec.md`       |
| 3        | File Layout    | HIGH     | `rules/file-layout.md`   |
| 4        | Naming         | HIGH     | `rules/naming-conventions.md` |
| 5        | Imports        | MEDIUM   | `rules/imports.md`       |
| 6        | Visibility     | MEDIUM   | `rules/visibility.md`    |
| 7        | General Rules  | MEDIUM      | `rules/general-rules.md` |

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples (correct and incorrect).

## Quick Reference

### 1. Gas Optimization (CRITICAL)

**Gas efficiency is critical for Linea contracts.** Apply these rules unless there is a documented safety, audit, or readability reason to deviate.

See [rules/gas-optimization.md](rules/gas-optimization.md) for details.

### 2. NatSpec Docstrings (HIGH)

**ALWAYS use NatSpec docstrings for all public/external items.**

Consult [rules/natspec.md](rules/natspec.md) for NatSpec docstring rules and examples

### 3. File Layout (HIGH)

**Interface structure:**
1. Structs → 2. Enums → 3. Events → 4. Errors → 5. External Functions

**Contract structure:**
1. Using statements → 2. Constants → 3. State variables → 4. Structs → 5. Enums → 6. Events → 7. Errors → 8. Modifiers → 9. Functions

See [rules/file-layout.md](rules/file-layout.md) for templates.

### 4. Naming Conventions (HIGH)

See [rules/naming-conventions.md](rules/naming-conventions.md) for symbol naming conventions.

### 5. Imports (MEDIUM)

Always use named imports.
Always insert a blank line after imports.

See [rules/imports.md](rules/imports.md) for details.

### 6. Visibility (MEDIUM)

See [rules/visibility.md](rules/visibility.md) for rules on applying visibility modifiers (`internal`, `external`, `public`, etc).

### 7. General Rules (MEDIUM)

See [rules/general-rules.md](rules/general-rules.md) for inheritance and general style rules
