  # Ideally we would use dorny/paths-filter@v3 to conditionally trigger an upload job based on file changes
  # However there is a limitation in Github Actions where workflows triggered by a `workflow_run` event have no access to metadata on external fork PRs - https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/25220
  # Hence we are unable to find the base commit (the common ancestor commit between the PR branch and main branch) without using very clunky workarounds
  # Hence we cannot provide the correct set of 'before' and 'after' commits for dorny/paths-filter@v3 to accurately assess PR file changes
  # So instead we unconditionally use 'continue-on-error: true' and try to download every possible test coverage report that we want to upload to Codecov
