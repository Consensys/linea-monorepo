            Yes — find the &apos;To different address&apos; button beneath the field that displays the amount of ETH or
            tokens you will receive on the target chain. You can then enter the address you want the funds to be bridged
            to. Only send funds to addresses on Ethereum Mainnet or Linea Mainnet. You may lose funds otherwise, and
            they will be irretrievable (see this{" "}

        <Collapse title="I need to claim a transaction. What do I do?">
          <p>
            If you chose manual claiming, you need to return to the Linea Bridge and make an additional transaction. It
            typically takes around 20 minutes (two Ethereum epochs) before you can claim a deposit; withdrawals from
            Linea can take much longer, and vary in duration.
          </p>
          <p>
            To claim, head to the &apos;Transactions&apos; tab and locate the bridge transaction you want to claim; it
            should be marked as &apos;Ready to claim&apos;. Click on it, and then on the &apos;Claim&apos; button to
            initiate the transaction.
          </p>
        </Collapse>

        <Collapse title="What fees will I pay?">
          <p>
            Linea does not charge fees for using the bridge. However, you will need to pay gas fees for transactions.
            Gas fees vary according to network activity, so we cannot accurately predict how much you&apos;ll pay. The
            bulk of the cost will be for interacting with Ethereum Mainnet; Linea&apos;s gas fees are considerably
            cheaper.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you use manual claiming, you pay gas fees for the bridge transaction and then gas fees for the claim
            transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            For automatic claiming, you pay gas fees for your initial bridge transaction and then a fee to cover the gas
            costs of the postman executing the claim on your behalf.

        <Collapse title="Why can I only select Linea Mainnet and Ethereum Mainnet?">
          <p>
            The Linea Bridge is designed to transact between layer 1 (Ethereum Mainnet) and layer 2 (Linea Mainnet),
            rather than for bridging to any other chains.
          </p>

            First, check whether your funds are ready to claim. To see claimable funds, go to the “Transactions” tab of
            the Linea Bridge app.
          </p>

            If claiming isn&apos;t the issue, head to Lineascan and see if the transaction is pending, and in the queue:

            If the transaction is still pending, just wait for it to be confirmed, and your funds will be available to
            claim or will be in your wallet (depending on the claiming method you chose). If the transaction is missing,

            Note that this only speeds up your submission of the bridge transaction. It does not actually speed up the
            bridging process itself that you initiate with this transaction — you cannot speed up the 8-32 hour waiting
            time for a withdrawal.
