## Creating GitHub Issues

When creating a GitHub issue or ticket in this repository, you **must** use one of the issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:

- **bug-report.md** - For filing bug reports. Requires impact, steps to reproduce, actual result, and expected result.
- **feature_request.md** - For feature requests. Requires description, motivation, tasks, acceptance criteria, and risks.
- **epic.md** - For epics or major features. Requires description, motivation, architecture, implementation guidelines, and rollout plan.
- **operational_task_template.md** - For operational tasks. Requires problem statement, background, desired solution, and acceptance criteria.

Read the chosen template file before creating the issue and fill in all sections. Do not create blank issues - this repository has blank issues disabled.
